# Lex Van-Nugent Personal Website

This is a personal website portfolio for Lex Van-Nugent, a Junior Web Developer and Professional Voice Actor. The website is built using React and Next.js, and includes various components such as a navigation bar, a hero section with a typed animation, an about section with a photo gallery, and a loading spinner.

## Project Structure

This project showcases the following technology stacks:

- **Front-end:** React, Next.js, and various React libraries such as `react-typed` and `react-icons`.
- **Styling:** CSS and the `tailwindcss` library.
- **Back-end:** There doesn't appear to be any back-end code in this project, as it is a static website. However, it is possible that the website could be connected to a back-end in the future to add dynamic functionality.

Overall, this project showcases a modern front-end stack using popular technologies such as React and Next.js, as well as a utility-first CSS framework (`tailwindcss`) for styling.
